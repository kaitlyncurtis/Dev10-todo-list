    <!--I replaced the links for Bootstrap starter template (from WebDev course) with links/code for version 5.0.0-->
    <!--which I found in the Bootstrap documentation. It seems to work the same but I notice there is only 1 .js file linked-->
    <!--and no links/reference to any jQuery - the refresher assignment mentions something about jQuery and how it has fallen out of favor, so maybe this is preferable?-->

    <!--trying to use HTML5 form control validation, required attribute and min attribute for the number-->
    <!--its not working. guide I read says that required is a boolean attribute and if not complete, you can't submit the form-->
    <!--but maybe since i am using the button differently, those attributes aren't being checked/triggered?-->

    <!--ok I learned: 1. my button was outside the form which idk if that actually had an impact but probably should be inside it-->
    <!--2. the validation DID NOT work when I had the button type attribute set to "button"; it only works when type is submit or if you don't include type attribute-->
    <!--3. there is another uhhhh event attribute you can use, onsubmit, that only runs the function when the form is SUBMITTED-->
    <!--(when that attribute was still set to onclick, it was throwing the "tooltip" but still creating the alert which was unwanted/invalid)-->

    <!--ok so now valiation is active but it's not creating alerts........ like it did before-->
    <!--i wonder what is ACTUALLY meant by submit like does a server need to be involved? -->
    <!--I don't have like a get method or post method, maybe that has something to do with it-->
